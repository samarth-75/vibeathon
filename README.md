## 🌟 Project Overview

**VaidyaAI** is an **AI-powered medical report simplification and health companion platform** designed to help patients understand complex medical reports in a **simple, human-friendly, and multilingual way**.

Medical reports often contain complicated medical terms and numerical values that are difficult for common people—especially elderly patients and rural populations—to interpret.

**VaidyaAI bridges this gap** by presenting clear explanations, highlighted abnormalities, and ethical AI-assisted guidance — **without replacing doctors**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Patients frequently receive medical reports that:

- ❌ Are filled with medical jargon  
- ❌ Cause confusion and anxiety  
- ❌ Are difficult to explain to family members  
- ❌ Require a doctor’s interpretation for basic understanding  

📌 There is a strong need for a **supportive, non-diagnostic digital tool** that prepares patients *before* doctor consultation.

VaidyaAI transforms complex medical data into:

- ✅ Easy-to-read explanations  
- 🌐 Multilingual outputs
